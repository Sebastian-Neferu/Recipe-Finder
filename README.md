# Recipe-Finder

Practice app for learning to code in modern JavaScript (ES6, Webpack 4, Babel etc.).
Coded along as part of the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course: Build Real-World Projects". 
For apps that I coded entirely on my own, see my "Codeducation" and "To-Do-List" repositories.

An update is planned for December 2018 to turn this app into a recipe transformer that would substitute non-vegan ingredients with vegan ingredients, or provide a substitute vegan recipe for every recipe found.
A further update is planned for December 2018 to add several new features, e.g. the ability to completely empty the shopping list with one click.
